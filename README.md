# CS-2210---Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
These are some of the projects that I made during my data structures and algorithms course in Fall 2023. :woman_student:	

The description of these assignments are as follows:

- Assignment 4 tested my understanding of ordered dictionaries, binary search trees, hash functions, hash maps, and UI. We were tasked to create an Interface that stored, displayed and manipulated user data correctly and efficently. My raw score on this assignment was 18/20 (90%).
- Assignment 5 tasked me to create a Graph data structure that acted as a maze and, by utilizing Breadth First Search, found the best path from the start of the maze to the end (if it exists) based on various conditions. My raw score on this assignment was 19/20 (95%).

This class very challenging but also incredibly interesting and rewarding. There are pdfs that explain the assignments in greater detail and include the grading system used.

Thank you for taking the time to look at my assignments. :smile:
