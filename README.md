# CS-2210---Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
These are some of the projects that I made during my data structures and algorithms course in Fall 2023. :woman_student:	

The description of these assignments and run instructions are as follows:

- Assignment 4 tested my understanding of ordered dictionaries, binary search trees, hash functions, hash maps, and UI. We were tasked to create a database that stored, displayed and manipulated user data correctly and efficently. My raw score on this assignment was 18/20 (90%).
  To run this project after loading it onto your machine, go to the terminal of the Interface.java file and compile by typing 'javac Interface.java' then you can run it by typing 'java Interface small.txt' or 'java Interface large.txt'. This loads the database and allows the program to run effectively.
- Assignment 5 tasked me to create a Graph data structure that acted as a maze and, by utilizing Breadth First Search, found the best path from the start of the maze to the end (if it exists) based on various conditions. My raw score on this assignment was 19/20 (95%).
  To run this program, go to the 'Solve.java' file and open it up in the terminal. Compile the file by typing 'javac Solve.java' then run it by typing 'java Solve maze1.txt'. There are 9 mazes total that you can test. 

This class very challenging but also incredibly interesting and rewarding. There are pdfs that explain the assignments in greater detail and include the grading system used.

Thank you for taking the time to look at my assignments. :smile:
